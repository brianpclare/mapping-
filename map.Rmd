## Water Map with 4 locations
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggmap(map_water) +
  geom_point(
    aes(x = df$lon, y = df$lat),
    data = df, color = "red", size = 3

```

The four locations on the water map represent Crooklets Beach, Summerleaze Beach,Bude North Cornwall Cricket Club and The Barrel at Bude.

## Road Map with 4 locations and shortest distance 
```{r, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}

    data = route_df, lineend = "round")+
  geom_point(aes(x=df$lon, y=df$lat),
             data=df, color = "red", size=2)
```

  image_annotate("Summerleaze Beach", size = 20, color = "white")
plot(SummerleazeBeach)
